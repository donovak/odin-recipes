# odin-recipes

First project for The Odin Project.

Focusing on basic html use by creating a simple recipe website using only html.

Most of the html coding so far felt pretty intuitive and was fairly simple to get through.

Git usage was poor, should probably be making significantly more commits and making sure everything is separated so each commit can have a clear message. Could see pretty quickly where most of my major errors here were at least so should be able to clean things up next time.
