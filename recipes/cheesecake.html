        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic baked cheesecake that's easy to make and delicious.</p>
        <p><strong>Serves 12 - Total time: 1 hr 15 mins</strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g plain biscuit</li>
            <li>120g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>500g cream cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (125g) sour cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (330g) caster sugar</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>Mixed berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries etc.)</li>
            <li>Icing/powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 160C/320F (standard) or 140C/295F (fan/convection).</li>
            <li>Get a 20cm/8" springform cake tin. Turn the base UPSIDE DOWN.</li>
            <li>Butter lightly and place a square piece of parchment/baking paper on the base. Then clip into the springform pan - excess paper will stick out</li>
            <li>Butter and line the side of the pan</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Biscuit Base</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor.</li>
            <li>Blitz until fine crumbs. Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand.</li>
            <li>Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls.</li>
            <li>Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (I used a measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until smooth - about 30 seconds on medium high.</li>
            <li>Add flour, beat until just combined (10 sec).</li>
            <li>Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 - 15 sec).</li>
            <li>Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined (10 sec each). Don't over beat, do not want to aerate the batter.</li>
            <li>Pour into prepared crust.</li>
            <li>Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan.</li>
            <li>Cool the cake in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8", then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan.</li>
            <li>Remove sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.</li>
            <li>Top with berries and dust with icing sugar!</li>
        </ol>
